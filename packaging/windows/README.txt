Luma for Windows
================

Install or update
-----------------
1. Extract this ZIP to a folder (do not run Install from inside the ZIP).
2. Close Luma and Windows Screen Saver Settings.
3. Double-click Install.cmd. No administrator rights are needed.
4. Windows Screen Saver Settings opens. Check that Luma is selected,
   choose your wait time and sign-in preference, then click Apply.

The package installs to %LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\Screensaver.
Run Install.cmd again from a newer extracted package to update.
Your palette, speed, size, and quality preferences are preserved.
The installer selects Luma but does not alter the activation setting,
wait time, or password requirement. Review these in the Windows panel.

Configure
---------
Click Settings in Windows Screen Saver Settings to change Luma's appearance.
Changes apply when the next screensaver or preview instance starts.

Uninstall
---------
Double-click Uninstall.cmd, either in this package or in the installation
folder. Close Luma and Windows Screen Saver Settings first.
The previous screensaver is restored if still available and Luma is still
selected. If you selected a different saver, that choice is left alone.
Preferences in %LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\settings.json are kept.

Existing manual installation
----------------------------
A manually copied Luma.scr is not removed by this installer. The new
per-user copy is selected instead. You may remove the old copy separately.

Notes
-----
Windows PowerShell is required. These scripts and the binary are unsigned;
Windows or organization policies may require approval before running them.
This package does not bypass organization screen saver policies.
The SHA256SUMS.txt file can detect accidental package corruption; it is
not a digital signature and does not establish the publisher's identity.
