![Luma — Windows screensaver](docs/luma-banner.svg)

# Luma

A Windows screensaver with flowing, GPU-rendered light. Based on [Flux by Sander Melnikov](https://github.com/sandydoo/flux), inspired by the Drift screensaver on macOS.

Luma is an independent MIT-licensed fork, currently under development.

[Website](https://luma.ksmvc.ch) · [Releases](https://github.com/Ken5998/luma/releases)

## Features

- Fullscreen animation on each display connected at startup.
- Independent scenes with per-monitor resolution and DPI scaling.
- Five color palettes, including Aurora: teal, violet, and pink inspired by northern lights.
- An optional local-time clock, centered at the top of a chosen display.
- Hidden cursor in screensaver mode.
- Exit all screens with a key press, mouse click, scroll, or mouse movement.
- A two-second input grace period after each window's first frame prevents accidental startup exits. Keyboard auto-repeat is ignored; mouse movement uses an 8-logical-pixel threshold.
- A windowed desktop mode for development and testing.

## Install, update, or uninstall

Release packages offer two options:

- **`Luma-<version>-Setup-x64.exe`**: a graphical installer for the current user, with an entry in Windows Installed Apps. No administrator rights are needed.
- **`Luma-<version>-windows-x64.zip`**: the screensaver with PowerShell install/uninstall scripts.

Both use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\Screensaver` and preserve appearance preferences. Close Luma and Windows Screen Saver Settings before installing or updating. The graphical installer also supports upgrades from the script-based installation. If you installed with Setup, uninstall from Windows Installed Apps or run `Uninstall.cmd` to open the registered uninstaller.

Extract the Windows ZIP, close Luma and Windows Screen Saver Settings, then double-click **Install.cmd**. It installs for the current user in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\Screensaver`, selects Luma, and opens Windows Screen Saver Settings. Check the wait time and sign-in preference, then click Apply. No administrator rights are needed.

Run Install.cmd from a newer extracted package to update. Existing appearance preferences are kept. If the executable is in use, close the screensaver, preview, and settings window, then retry.

To uninstall, run **Uninstall.cmd** from the package or installation folder. It restores the previous screensaver if that file still exists and Luma is still selected. A newer screensaver choice is left unchanged. `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\settings.json` is preserved.

The scripts change only the current user's screensaver executable selection. They do not change activation, idle timeout, or password requirements. Windows applies the executable selection on its next screensaver launch ([Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/scrnsave-exe)). Organization policies may override the selection.

Previously installed manual copies are not removed. The per-user copy becomes the selected screensaver.

## Build

Requires Windows, a stable Rust toolchain installed with rustup, and Visual Studio Build Tools with the C++ x64 tools and Windows SDK.

Run from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows.ps1
```

The script produces `target\release\Luma.exe` and `target\release\Luma.scr`, and copies the MIT license alongside them. The first build needs access to crates.io.

### Create a distributable package

```powershell
.\scripts\package-windows.ps1
```

Produces `target\distribution\Luma-windows-x64.zip` and its SHA-256 checksum. The ZIP includes the screensaver, installer, uninstaller, instructions, license, and checksums for its files. It uses the freshly built executable, even if an older development `.scr` is locked by Windows.

For versioned release assets, install Inno Setup 6.7+ and run:

```powershell
.\scripts\package-release.ps1 -IsccPath 'C:\path\to\ISCC.exe'
```

This creates the Setup executable, ZIP, and `SHA256SUMS.txt` under `target\releases\<version>`. Luma starts its own release numbering at v0.1.0, independent of the inherited Flux version.

The [VirusTotal workflow](docs/VIRUSTOTAL.md) scans final release assets using the
`VT_API_KEY` repository secret and adds report links to the release notes. It runs
on release publication or manually for an existing release or draft. Reports do
not replace code signing or remove Windows SmartScreen warnings.

### Deployment tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\test-deployment.ps1
```

Tests installation, replacement, locked files, restoring the original selection, preserving a newer selection, and keeping preferences. They use disposable repository folders and a simulated registry boundary; they do not change the selected Windows screensaver. Registry integration and the Windows settings panel should be checked on an actual installation.

## Run

```powershell
# Windowed desktop application
.\target\release\Luma.exe

# Fullscreen screensaver on all connected displays
.\scripts\run-screensaver.ps1

# Run the .scr executable in a window
.\scripts\run-screensaver.ps1 -Windowed
```

The launcher runs the executable directly because the Windows `.scr` file association can replace command-line arguments.

### Windows screensaver modes

| Argument | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `/s` | Fullscreen screensaver on every display detected at startup |
| `--windowed` | Windowed desktop prototype |
| `/c` | Open the settings window |
| `/p <HWND>` or `/p:<HWND>` | Animated preview embedded in the supplied Windows window; follows its size and exits when the host closes |
| No arguments | Windowed mode for `.exe`; settings window for `.scr` |

## Settings

Open **Settings** in Windows Screen Saver Settings, or run:

```powershell
.\target\release\Luma.exe /c
```

- **Color palette:** Original, Plasma, Poolside, Freedom, or Aurora.
- **Animation speed:** 50–200% of the default speed.
- **Line size:** 50–200%, independent of display DPI.
- **Simulation quality:** Low, Balanced (default), or High. Higher quality uses more GPU resources on each display.
- **Show clock:** Off by default; displays local time in 24-hour format at the top center.
- **Clock display:** Primary display or a specific monitor. If that monitor is unavailable, the clock falls back to the primary display. Windowed mode and the Windows preview show the clock when enabled.

**Save** writes preferences to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Luma\settings.json`. **Cancel** leaves the file unchanged. **Restore defaults** resets the controls; use Save to keep those values.

Preferences apply when a new desktop, screensaver, or preview instance starts. A running animation is not updated live. Missing settings use defaults; unreadable or invalid files produce a log warning and safe defaults. Saving from the settings window replaces invalid files.

The Windows Forms settings panel is embedded in the executable and uses the Windows PowerShell included with Windows. No companion script needs to be installed. A system policy that blocks PowerShell can prevent the settings window from opening.

Update managed installations by running Install.cmd from the new package. Manual installations still require replacing their `.scr` file. Rebuilding this repository does not update installed copies.

## Tests

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release -p luma -p luma-desktop
```

GPU tests are ignored by default. Run them on a machine with a supported GPU:

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release -p luma -p luma-desktop -- --ignored --test-threads=1
```

The embedded settings form also has an integration test that uses an isolated temporary preferences file:

```powershell
cargo test --locked --release -p luma-desktop --bin Luma embedded_settings_form -- --ignored
```

### Manual acceptance checks

1. Run the windowed application and check animation and resizing.
2. Launch the screensaver with multiple displays connected; each should fill its own screen without borders or a visible cursor.
3. Check mixed resolutions and DPI settings, including displays positioned left of or above the primary display.
4. Let the startup grace period finish, then move the mouse or press a key. All windows should close together.
5. Repeat from PowerShell to check that startup modifier-key events do not close the screensaver.

Automated tests do not replace visual checks on real multi-monitor hardware.

### Preview integration test

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\test-preview.ps1
```

This opens a temporary host window, launches the `.scr` with `/p`, checks its child window and two sizes, then closes the host and verifies that Luma exits. It does not install or select the screensaver. Preview mode keeps the cursor visible and ignores keyboard/mouse exit gestures. A valid host HWND is required; a missing host exits quietly.

After replacing an installed copy, check its preview and Settings button in Windows Screen Saver Settings.

## Diagnostics

The launcher enables informational logging. Luma writes `Luma.log` next to its executable (`target\release\Luma.log` for a local build), including detected displays, the first rendered frame on each display, and input-triggered exits. The file is overwritten on each launch. If it cannot be created, logging falls back to stderr.

Losing focus does not close the screensaver.

## Roadmap and current limits

- Display hot-plug handling; restart Luma after connecting or disconnecting a monitor.
- Custom application icon.
- Performance tuning for multiple high-resolution displays. Each display currently owns a separate simulation and GPU context; scenes do not span display boundaries.

Both graphical and script-based per-user installers are available.

## Website

The English landing page lives in [`site/`](site/README.md), with interactive palette illustrations and an optional clock preview. The GitHub Actions workflow builds and tests the Windows package, then publishes the site and download together through GitHub Pages. See the [deployment instructions](site/README.md) for the custom domain `luma.ksmvc.ch`.

## Repository structure

| Directory | Purpose |
